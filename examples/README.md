# Examples

These examples should provide a reasonable entrypoint to using *OCat* while
showcasing the features that should make you want to use it.  
I'd recommend the following reading order:

  1. [Monoids](monoid_example.ml) (basic usage patterns for the library)
  1. [Functors](functor_example.ml) (can be safely skipped)
  1. [Monads](monad_example.ml)
  1. [Cofree](cofree_example.ml)
  1. [Fixed-point recursion](fix_example.ml)
